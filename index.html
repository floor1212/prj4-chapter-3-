It could be anything except art Pleunie : Via the radio, television, and newspaper. I usually watch informative and educational advertising  Floor: Can you be open to a completely different and new way of promoting art? Pleunie : Yes, if it is conveyed in a good way, I am certainly open to this!  Floor: If you sell your art do you think the promotion will help you sell your artwork, or have you experienced this? Pleunie : When I look at my sales after it has been exhibited at a gallery, they are considerably higher. because then the gallery owner also tells a story about my work. Word of mouth is the most prolific promotional tool for me </p></div>

Do you feel that if the artists made a video more mysterious, you would be more interested? </span>Pleunie : Yes, of course, then you will be curious to see the entire artwork. I think it is a very nice way of presenting art.Floor: How would you like to interact with a sculptor through social media? Pleunie : I have a lot of contact with sculptors through social media. It is a small world so you have a lot of contact with everyone. We share tips and tricks. Regarding the potential buyers on social media, I think it is very nice that they can easily find me and that I can approach them warmly using a personal message.</p>
